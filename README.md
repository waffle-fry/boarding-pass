# Boarding Pass

Boarding Pass is a desktop application that intends to streamline and improve upon the onboarding process at any organisation (with an eye toward engineers).

The application takes a (as yet incomplete) config-as-code approach to the onboarding journey, with the intention that it would be engineers - not managers or someone in HR - who would define and update the journey as necessary.

As it stands, the app is both incomplete and very minimal.

## Prerequisits

You'll need NPM for this.

## Running the app

cd <project folder>
npm install #if it's your first time
npm start
```

npm run test
```
